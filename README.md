## Zomato SQL Analyzer
This project leverages SQL to analyze the Zomato dataset, providing insights into restaurant ratings, cuisines, pricing, and locations. The analysis is designed to extract valuable business insights and deliver data-driven recommendations.

### Key Features
- **Restaurant Ratings Analysis**: Query and analyze restaurant ratings to identify top-performing venues.
- **Cuisine Popularity**: Identify the most popular cuisines in different regions based on user reviews.
- **Price vs. Rating Correlation**: Investigate the relationship between pricing and customer ratings to find trends.
- **Top Restaurants**: Filter and list the highest-rated restaurants based on various criteria such as cuisine, location, and price.

### Interactive Filters
- **Dynamic Queries**: Users can apply filters like location, price range, cuisine type, and rating thresholds to dynamically adjust SQL queries and get tailored results.
- **Custom Filtering**: Using SQL WHERE clauses, users can generate specific outputs by setting their preferred filters for data exploration.

### User Interface
Though the core of the project is built using SQL, the results are enhanced with a simple user interface where users can:
- **Enter Query Parameters**: Users can specify custom filters and conditions.
- **View Results**: The output from SQL queries is displayed in tables and charts.

### Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the dataset.
- **Database Management Systems**: The project uses a relational database to store and query the Zomato dataset (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Optional Backend**: A lightweight backend could be used (e.g., Flask or Node.js) to handle SQL queries and serve the UI.
